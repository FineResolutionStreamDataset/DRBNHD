## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Training SpatioTemporal Models
- **Low-resolution DRB dataset**: Run `coarse.py`
- **High-resolution DRB dataset**: Run `base.py`

### Basic Downscaling Methods
Run the following scripts for different downscaling approaches:
- `remap.py`
- `direct_upscaling.py`
- `progress_upscaling.py`

## ðŸ”§ Model Architecture

All spatiotemporal models are located in the `multiscale.MODEL` module with references. 

**Note**: The models maintain their original GitHub implementations, with minor modifications to the first and final layers of the forward function to accommodate our specific use case.
